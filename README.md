# illuminight ðŸŒŸ

A modern take on the classic "Lights Out" puzzle game, built with React Native and Expo.

## Game Concept

illuminight is a challenging puzzle game where players interact with a 5x5 grid of lights. The goal is simple yet engaging:

-   Tap any light to toggle its state (on/off)

-   Every puzzle is mathematically guaranteed to be solvable
